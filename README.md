University Admission Prediction (Date: 2021-10 to 2021-11)
Project Overview: Developed a predictive model to determine the likelihood of university admissions based on various factors using machine learning techniques.
Key Responsibilities:
•	Data Collection and Cleaning:
o	Gathered historical data on university admissions from Kaggle , including academic scores, extracurricular activities, and demographic information.
o	Performed extensive data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
•	Exploratory Data Analysis:
o	Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships of features with pandas profiling to understand the data structure and manage the data.
•	Feature Engineering:
o	Created new features to enhance the predictive power of the model.
o	Normalized and scaled numerical features to ensure model stability and performance.
•	Model Development:
o	Implemented linear regression algorithm to conduct model development.
o	Utilized cross-validation techniques to optimize model parameters and prevent overfitting.
o	Used Pickle library to save the model for performing further analysis  
•	Model Evaluation:
o	Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
o	Conducted whether the model is stable or not .
•	Deployment and Presentation:
o	Deployed the final model in a user-friendly application for real-time predictions.
o	Presented findings and insights to stakeholders through comprehensive reports and visualizations.
Technologies Used:
•	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pickle, Seaborn)
•	Jupyter Notebook
Key Achievements:
•	Successfully increased the prediction accuracy for university admissions by 84%.
